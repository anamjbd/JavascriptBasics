<!-- In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation is completed. It's a way to ensure that code is not executed until a certain task has finished, helping in asynchronous programming.


1. Passing a Function as an Argument: You can pass a function as an argument to another function.


2. Executed After Completion: The callback function is executed when the function it was passed to has finished its work or reaches a certain point.
